# Laravel Senior Developer Assessment - Laravel 12 (Scaffold)

**What this ZIP contains**
- A ready-to-review code scaffold implementing Task A (Bulk CSV import + chunked image upload) and Task B (User Discounts Laravel package).
- Implementations are *framework-ready* PHP files (controllers, models, migrations, services) and PHPUnit tests.
- This is a code scaffold: to run locally you must have PHP >= 8.2, Composer, and a Laravel 12 app created (`laravel new`), or run `composer install` to install dependencies.

**Notes**
- Laravel version targeted: **12.x** (released Feb 24, 2025). See https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/releases.
- Run `composer install`, copy files into your Laravel project's root, run migrations and tests:
  - `php artisan migrate`
  - `php artisan test`

See `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md` for further guidance.
